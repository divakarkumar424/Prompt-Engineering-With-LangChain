LangChain is an open-source framework designed for building applications with language models such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. It boasts robust support for advanced prompt engineering, which involves optimizing text inputs to elicit accurate and relevant responses from language models. Prompt engineering entails crafting prompts in natural language to specify tasks for AI models, ranging from simple queries to creative requests like writing poems. Key aspects include selecting appropriate wording, tone, and context, and even guiding the AI's learning process through examples. For models generating images or audio, prompts detail desired outputs, allowing for adjustment to guide the AI toward desired results.
